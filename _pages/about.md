Hi!

Welcome to the profile of Daman YANG.

I am currently a second-year undergrad student in **South China University of Technology (華南理工大學 SCUT)**, majoring in **Robotics Engineering** at Shien-Ming Wu School of Intelligent Engineering and minoring in Law.
Currently I am having academic courses (English-Medium-Instruction) and doing research and development in Prof. Shaofeng LU's research program on Smart Transport Lighting. My research interests lie in the domain of embedded systems, communications, distributed computing, and IoT. I am expecting more research opportunities!

Beyond my research pursuits, I am also taking full charge of a **tech start-up**, serving CITATEK Co., Ltd. as the CEO, founder, and engineer. We mainly focus on **AIoT Smart Hardware** and our first product is now at the stage of EVT (Engineering Verification Test). We warmly welcome investors and founders to get in touch with us!

I regard myself as an **engineer-like and PM-like Product Engineer**, attentive to all aspects of a thing/product -- from marketing, business and SCM to R&D and delivery etc. -- not just the technology. 

Look forward to any opportunities or communications about research and start-up. Please feel free to reach out to me and engage in discussions on any topic.
